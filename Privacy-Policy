ADAM SKELTON (ZABA) PRIVACY POLICY
Documented: 17 AUG 20

Bug Bash - Android Play Store application:


It is my intention as a developer solely to offer a delightful and informative utility in "Bug Bash."

At this point, my app makes no effort to collect any user data.
I have no servers on which to store this data, and no imaginable reason to need any user data.

"Bug Bash" displays information, and may be visually customized by the user, but currently serves
no advertisements nor offers any payments through intermediary systems which might themselves collect user data.

It is feasible that in the foreseeable future, "Bug Bash" will recieve many feature updates,
and may include banner advertisements as a means to generate revenue.

If ads are to be included, this update would be notified to users and this privacy policy would be updated to reflect the change.
Still, in this case, as a developer I have no intention of collecting any user data but, for example, may need to include
information on other binding privacy policies.

Finally, the content of "Bug Bash" is just as family friendly as the content within the game "Grounded"
by Obsidian Entertainment for which the companion utility was developed; which is rated T for Teen by the ESRB.
