# bug_bash
Companion application for Obsidian Entertainment's yard simulator Grounded.

## Play Store description:
"Grounded" by Obsidian Entertainment (Xbox Game Studios) recently released to Xbox Game Pass under release preview to warm acclaim.

The game is a sandbox where the player may build structures, craft tools and armor, and truly work at his or her own pace.
As new recipes and resources are discovered and analyzed in game, deeper craftable items and buildings bubble up.

Use this app Bug Bash to gain an early edge by browsing all that Grounded has to offer without the need to unlock these discoveries!  See a resource glossary with item details, peruse the ingredients required for smoothie recipes, or find out how to craft that incredible bounce web.

Bug Bash also includes a rudimentary map of the yard that supports zooming and panning.  Expect an update with a toggle to view points of interest superimposed on the map, as well as a list of POIs that can be tapped to home in on the image.

On the whole you can expect this app to be regularly updated until it is feature-complete; after which maintenance updates will occur as Grounded receives monthly updates from Obsidian.

As a game designer by education, but with little in my portfolio and a limited experience, the development of this Flutter application stands to jump start a new hobby.  The more I learn, the better Bug Bash becomes.  Often, discoveries are made that result in earlier portions of the app being restarted.  This means you will eventually receive an incredible companion: well-coded, visually delightful, and quick to utilize; but in the meantime I hope you do not mind observing me hone my development skills.

Thanks and enjoy!
